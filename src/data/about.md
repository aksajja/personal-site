# Intro

I'm knowledge hungry and at any point in time I have a variety of interests. At the moment I am currently interested in statistical machine learning, deep learning theory, the interplay between ML & optimization problems and decentralized projects beyond cryptocurrencies. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Arizona State University, I have co-authored my first publication. It was a very interesting time as I was a part of 'Deep learning theory' and 'Randomized numerical linear algebra' reading groups. As a part of these reading groups we referenced the [lecture notes](https://mjt.cs.illinois.edu/dlt/) by Matus Telgarsky and the [lecture notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01387) by Per-Gunnar Martinsson & Joel Tropp respectively. This has spurred a renewed interest in math. The work towards a thesis defense in 'Regression analysis' is underway.
