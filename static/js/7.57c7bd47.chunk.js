At the moment I am currently interested in statistical machine learning, deep learning theory, the interplay between ML & optimization problems and decentralized projects beyond cryptocurrencies. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt Arizona State University, I have co-authored my first publication. It was a very interesting time as I was a part of deep learning theory and randomized numerical linear algebra reading groups. This has spurred a renewed interest in math. The work towards a thesis defense in 'Regression analysis' is underway.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Basketball\n- Tennis\n- Space\n- Summer (anywhere but in a desert)\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143537145-akarshan)\n\n\n\n\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(i.b,Object(r.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Akarshan Sajja",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(o.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
